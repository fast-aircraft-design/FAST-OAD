# IMPORTANT: when modifying this list, docs/requirements.txt must be updated for
# ReadTheDocs to be able to compile the documentation.
# A pre-commit hook has been added to do this task. As a result, any modification

# the commit fail because "files were modified by this hook". In that case,
# doing again the commit including changes in docs/requirements.txt will succeed.
