    Base class for macro-segments.

    A macro-segment is a sequence of flight segments. Parameters of the macro-segment drive the
    parameters of aggregated segments.

    A field value will be applied to all segments that have the concerned field. The exception is
    the `target` field, that is applied only on last segment.

    This class is expected to be used through :class:`MacroSegmentMeta`. It sets the basic
    mechanism for aggregating flight segments.

    Derived classes are expected to have dataclass fields that match dataclass fields
    of aggregated segment classes.
