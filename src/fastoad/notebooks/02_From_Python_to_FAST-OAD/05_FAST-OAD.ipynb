    "# The FAST-OAD framework\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main differences between FAST-OAD and OpenMDAO is that FAST-OAD uses specific files as user interface, the main one being the configuration file. This configuration file enables the user to change the model that are used by simply changing some lines in this file. As a consequence, any change in the configuration file will change the problem that we want to solve. This creates an intermediate interface which allows the user to not go into the code. To do so, in FAST-OAD, each module can be registered using the decorator `@oad.RegisterOpenMDAOSystem` and a unique id.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start this notebook by only registering the global group. To make the IDs more identifiable in this tutorial, we will have them start with \"tutorial.\". The top of the file containing the [global group](modules/FAST-OAD/mtow_loop.py) will now look like: \n",
    "\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> from .geometry.geometry import ComputeGeometry\n",
    "> from .aerodynamics.aerodynamics import ComputeAerodynamics\n",
    "> from .mass.mass import ComputeMass\n",
    "> from .performance.performance import ComputePerformance\n",

    ">   \"\"\"\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of contents, other than adding the `@oad.RegisterOpenMDAOSystem` decorator, there is only one change needed compared to the models used in the [OpenMDAO notebook](04_OpenMDAO.ipynb). This change concerns the component that creates the design loop. Indeed, FAST-OAD does not yet support the affectation of the default value after the setup (which is how it was done in the [previous example](04_OpenMDAO.ipynb)), so we need to overwrite it inside the module that computes the new **MTOW**. It is important to do it because, if not done, OpenMDAO will start iterating with an MTOW of 1.0 kg (the default value in OpenMDAO) which will ultimately cause the process to crash, as illustrated in the [previous notebook](04_OpenMDAO.ipynb). The new building block is [here](modules/FAST-OAD/update_mtow/update_mtow.py), the only change being that when adding the output, we give a default value at 500.0 kg which is what we did in the previous example.\n",
