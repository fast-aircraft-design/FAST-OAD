    "The advantage of solving the MDA this way is that it is fairly simple to code and without a lot of prior knowledge in Python. Additionnaly, only basic libraries were used (we only used 3: numpy for easier data storage and mathematic operations, plotly for the graph and a subpackage of scipy which contains constants for easier unit conversion).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are however also a certain number of drawbacks : \n",
    "* Using a dichotomy method is a relatively slow way of solving an MDA problem, especially for more complex ones.\n",
    "* A recurring problem for this method and the method presented in [the next notebook](03_scipy.ipynb) is the units of the data. The functions were written to take only metric units or units derived from the metric system. This forces us to have some inputs written in an unusual way. The range, for instance, is written in meter. The usual way for an aircraft design problem would be to use nautical miles. This forces the user to handle the unit conversion by himself and to manipulate abstract data. It also imposes to be consistent with the units of the data, which is not always the case in the aircraft design formula (an example being the formula we used for the wing mass).\n",
    "* Another problem that will be illustrated in the next section is the lack of input/output modularity. By default only the new **MTOW** is returned here and we have have no access to intermediate data. This means that we would have to recode a new function if we wanted, let's say, the fuel consumed during the mission. We could alternatively print them. This, however, would not allow us to interact with the data, merely seeing them. We could also write them inside of a separate file but this would add unnecessary complexity. Finally, we could also create a dictionary with all data and their units but the construction would be manual and would need to be changed for each problem based on the models used."

    "### Fuel consumption optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now move on to the search for the aspect ratio that gives the best fuel consumption for the same mission. The issue here is that, in the default delivery of this tutorial and as mentioned before, we neither have access to intermediate computation (we could have used the value of the fuel consumed for the last computation of the **MTOW**) nor do we have a function that computes the fuel weight on its own. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the user will have to either code its own function, or modify the existing ones. Here, we chose the latter. This issue is easily fixed in FAST-OAD as will be shown later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us, the fuel is almost accessible as it is an output of a model main function, even if it is not returned by `mtow_loop`. To solve our issue, we only have to declare two outputs : the fuel and the **MTOW**. This is done in a new function, called `mtow_and_fuel_loop`, which can be found in the [mtow_and_fuel_loop.py file](modules/pure_python/mtow_and_fuel_loop.py). This change was made relatively easy by the fact that the fuel was already computed fairly close to the end result, but this may not always be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like for the `mtow_loop` function, we will define a function that solves the problem and returns the mission fuel that corresponds to the converged aircraft. Indeed, even if we aim at minimizing the fuel consumption, we still have the constraint of having a sized aircraft ! Said function does the same as the one presented [here](#solver_function) with the only difference being that we additionally make the fuel consumed available."
