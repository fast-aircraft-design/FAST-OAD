    "As in the first notebook, we will here try to find the aspect ratio that gives the least fuel consumed on the design mission. To do that, we will use another functionnality of `scipy.optimize` called [`minimize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html). This function can find the minimum of a function with respect to its design variables. Since we want to minimize the fuel consumption based on the aspect ratio, we will give it a function that outputs the fuel consumed on the mission and which has the aspect ratio as the design variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue, however, is that **MTOW** will also vary with aspect ratio. Thus, we will need to resize the aircraft for each **AR**. For the sake of this exercise, this can be seen as a constraint to our optimization. So, as an added constraint to our problem, we will tell the `minimize` function that it can modify the aspect ratio but only under the condition that `MTOW_to_solve` is equal to zero, meaning we have a converged aircraft.\n",

    "* Since we want to ensure that the MTOW is converged, there will be two functions of interest for the `minimize` function. This imposes that both function have to have the same inputs.\n",
    "* `minimize` can only take a single object as optimization variable. It can however be a tuple or an array when the function takes in reality more than one design variable. Their Python implementation, though, will need to use only a single variable. Consequently, we will need to reformat our functions so that it takes a tuple - which will contain the **MTOW** and the aspect ratio - as input and optimize the function using this tuple as design variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the function that returns the fuel consumed can go two ways. Either we reuse the `mtow_and_fuel_loop` that we modify to accept the right entry, or, we create a function that runs the performance model with all the other models needed beforehand (geometry for wing area, aerodynamics for lift-to-drag-ratio and weight for **OWE**). The latter solution was chosen and was implemented in a function called `compute_fuel_scipy` located in the [compute_fuel_scipy.py file](modules/python_for_scipy/compute_fuel_scipy.py).\n",

    "The reformatting of the `mtow_loop` implementation is done in the [mtow_loop_scipy.py file](modules/python_for_scipy/mtow_loop_scipy.py). As with the original `mtow_loop` function, we will then wrap it in a function that returns 0 when the aircraft is converged. This is done in the cell below."
