    "Components are defined as Python classes which must inherit from the OpenMDAO type of component we want to use for our method. In our case, as in a vast majority of models in FAST-OAD plugins, the component is an ExplicitComponent. Indeed, the goal of this component is simply to compute the lift-to-drag ratio in cruise. Since we know how to explicitly link the inputs to the output, this will be an ExplicitComponent. Thus, we must import the component from OpenMDAO API and create a new class based on the ExplicitComponent.\n",

    "### Defining the inputs/outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined the component, we must define its inputs and outputs. Contrary to a classic Python function, where they are defined in the signature, the definition is made in a separate class function called `setup`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each input/output we want to add to our component, we must provide :\n",
    "* The name of the variable: There is in OpenMDAO two variable linking startegies: promotion vs connection. In the former, data are linked based on their names while in the latter, the connection have to be made by hand. Because promoting variables is most convenient, this is the strategy that has been retained here and in most of FAST-OAD plugins. Consequently, it is crucial to keep the naming consistent. For instance two inputs/outputs named aspect_ratio and wing_aspect_ratio will not represent the same quantity even if, in reality, they might mean the same thing. For future users, a more detailed explanation of the variable naming in FAST-OAD is available [here](https://fast-oad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/custom_modules/add_modules.html?highlight=variable%20naming#variable-naming).\n",
    "* The unit of the variable: OpenMDAO supports automatic unit conversion. Therefore, different components that work with a same variable may use its value in different units without having to explicitly do the conversion.\n",
    "* The shape of the variable: By default, OpenMDAO variables are (1,)-shaped numpy arrays. They can have a different shape, which shall be declared in `setup`. Yet, an [advanced feature](https://openmdao.org/newdocs/versions/latest/features/experimental/dyn_shapes.html?highlight=shape_by_conn) allows a variable shape to be defined at runtime, based on a shape defined in another component.\n",
    "* The default value of the variable: This is the value OpenMDAO will use if the variable hasn't been computed beforehand. It may be a quick way of providing input values, but there are more versatile solutions, so we generally use `numpy.nan`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, the way we defined inputs in pure python was via the function signature. As for the handling of the units, it was made based on the assumption that each time we called the function we would respect the units in the docstring.

This enables to track if an input has not been set in data file nor in other components.\n",

    "For **outputs** however, a `numpy.nan` value should not be used because OpenMDAO will base its residuals computation on it. If a `numpy.nan` value is used on one of the outputs we loop on, OpenMDAO will see a residual equals to `numpy.nan`, causing the process to crash. The default value can however be overwritten by something else, in which case this value will be used as the value in the first iteration. It can also be defined in OpenMDAO once the problem is setup, which is how we will do it here.

    "The results are very close compared to the previous optimization. The slight difference is due to the fact that, when optimizing \"by hand\", the combinations are limited by the number of value that we allowed the **AR** and cruise speed to take. Here, thanks to OpenMDAO's capabilities, we can find the optimum solution. Indeed, hadn't we rounded the results, we would have seen that the result procided by OpenMDAO is better by 0.01 kg. The same remark could have been made on the [scipy](03_scipy.ipynb) notebook, had we done the exercise of doing a two variables optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Partial derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature of the OpenMDAO framework is the possibility to define explicit expression for [partial derivatives](https://openmdao.org/newdocs/versions/latest/advanced_user_guide/advanced_user_guide.html). This will not be detailled in this version of the tutorial but, in essence, this allows to reduce the number of evaluations of the components and thus, considerably reduce computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in this notebook, OpenMDAO allows for a much simpler definition of a MDA/MDO problem. The only thing that was really needed was to know how to construct the base bricks (components, no matter the type) and how to assemble them (the groups). Once this is done, the setup of the problem is pretty much always the same which simplify things a lot. In addition to that, OpenMDAO automatically handles the data processing, so as long as the names remain coherent, we don't have to worry about the wrong data being passed along, no matter how much there are. The unit conversion is even carried out spontaneously by OpenMDAO, which is one less source of possible error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, the difference in syntax from an MDA to an MDO is very thin and there is no need to change the models regardless of what variable we want to use as design parameter. For reminder, this was a strong drawback identified in the previous notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is however a couple of improvement that could be implemented to ease the use of OpenMDAO. The main one is user-friendliness. Indeed, from the creation of the problem and the addition of the module to the definition of the problem inputs, everything is done inside the Python file where all the commands are run. This might be a bit off-putting for new user. FAST-OAD, as will be explained in the [next notebook](05_FAST-OAD.ipynb), uses specific files to handle the setup and data initialization of the problem."
