The `fsolve` function will solve the equation f(x)=0 so we will need to change slightly the implementation. We will define the function that computes, for a given **MTOW**, the difference between the updated **MTOW** and the actual **MTOW**, which is similar to how we solve the dichotomy problem from the first notebook, and feed this function to the `fsolve` function.\n",
