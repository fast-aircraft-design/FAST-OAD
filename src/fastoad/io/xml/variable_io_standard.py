    Standard XML formatter for variables

    Assuming self.path_separator is defined as ``:`` (default), a variable named like
    ``foo:bar`` with units ``m/s`` will be read and written as:

    .. code:: xml

        <aircraft>
            <foo>
                <bar units="m/s" >`42.0</bar>
            </foo>
        <aircraft>

    When writing outputs of a model, OpenMDAO component hierarchy may be used by defining

     .. code:: python

        self.path_separator = '.'  # Discouraged for reading !
        self.use_promoted_names = False

    This way, a variable like ``componentA.subcomponent2.my_var`` will be written as:

    .. code:: xml

        <aircraft>
            <componentA>
                <subcomponent2>
                    <my_var units="m/s" >72.0</my_var>
