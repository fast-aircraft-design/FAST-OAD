class XPathReader:
    """
    Helper class for easing usage of XPath in FAST context. Assumption is
    that values are provided through dedicated tags (whatever the hierarchy
    depth) with an optional "unit" attribute.

    e.g.: in ``my_file.xml``:

    .. code-block:: xml

       <root>
            <foo>
                <bar unit="attoparsec">42</bar>
            </foo>
       </root>

    can be accessed through:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> XPathReader('my_file.xml').get_float('/root/foo/bar')
        42.0
        >>> XPathReader('my_file.xml').get_units('/root/foo/bar')
        'attoparsec'
