Version 1.4.1
=============
- Fixed:
    - Fixed backward compatibility of bundled missions. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/466)

Version 1.4.0
=============

- Changed:
    - Added a new series of tutorials. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/426)
    - Enhancements in mission module (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/430 and https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/462), mainly:
        - a parameter with a variable as value can now be associated to a unit and a default value that will be used in the OpenMDAO input declaration (and be in generated input data file).
        - a target parameter can be declared as relative to the start point of the segment by prefixing the parameter name with "delta_"
          when setting a parameter, a minus sign can be put before a variable name to get the opposite value (can be useful with relative values)
        - a parameter can now be set at route or mission level.
        - dISA can now be set in mission definition file with isa_offset.
        - a mission phase can now contain other phases.
        - if a segment parameter (dataclass field) is an array or a list, the associated variable in mission file will be declared with shape_by_conn=True.
        - taxi-out and takeoff are no more automatically set outside of the mission definition file:
            - mission starting point (altitude, speed, mass) can now be set using the "start" segment.
            - the mass input of the mission can be set using the "mass_input" segment. This segment can be anywhere in the mission, though it is expected that fuel consumption in previous segments is mass-independent.
            - if none of the two above solution is used to define a mass input variable, the mission module falls back to behaviour of earlier releases, i.e. the automatic addition of taxi-out and takeoff at beginning of the mission.
    - Upgrade to wop 2.x API. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/453)

- Fixed:
    - Variable viewer was showing only one variable at a time if variable names contained no colon. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/456)
    - Optimization viewer was handling incorrectly bounds with value 0. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/461)

Version 1.3.5
=============
- Fixed:
    - Deactivated automatic reports from OpenMDAO 3.17+ (can still be driven by environment variable OPENMDAO_REPORTS). (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/449)
    - Mass breakdown bar plot now accepts more than 5 datasets. The used color map is now consistent with othe FAST-OAD plots. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/451)

Version 1.3.4
=============
- Fixed:
    - FAST-OAD was quickly crashing in multiprocessing environment. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/442)
    - Memory consumption could increase considerably when numerous computations were done in the same Python session. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/443)
    - Deactivated sub-models kept being deactivated in following computations done in the same Python session. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/444)

Version 1.3.3
=============
- Fixed:
    - Fixed crash when using Newton solver or case recorders. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/434)
    -  DataFile class enhancement (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/435) :
        - Instantiating DataFile with an non-existent file now triggers an error.
        - DataClass.from_*() methods now return a DataClass instance instead of VariableList.
        - A dedicated section has been added in Sphinx documentation (General Documentation > Process variables > Serialization > FAST-OAD API).
    - A component input could be in FAST-OAD-generated input file though it was explicitly connected to an IndepVarComp output in configuration  file. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/437)

Version 1.3.2
=============
- Fixed:
    - Compatibility with OpenMDAO 3.17.0. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/428)

Version 1.3.1
=============
- Fixed:
    - Version requirements for StdAtm and FAST-OAD-CS25 were unwillingly pinned to 0.1.x. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/422)
    - `fastoad -v` was producing `unknown` when only FAST-OAD-core was installed. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/422)
    - Fixed some deprecation warnings. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/423)

        - Plugin group identifier is now `fastoad.plugins` (usage of `fastoad_model` is deprecated)
        - A plugin can now provide, besides models, notebooks and sample configuration files.
        - CLI and API have been updated to allow choosing the source when generating a configuration file, and to provide the needed information about installed plugin (`fastoad plugin_info`)
        - Models are loaded only when needed (speeds up some basic operations like `fastoad -h`)
    - CS25-related models are now in separate package [FAST-OAD-CS25](https://pypi.org/project/fast-oad-cs25/). This package is still installed along with FAST-OAD to preserve backward-compatibility. Also, package [FAST-OAD-core](https://pypi.org/project/fast-oad-core/) is now available, which does NOT install FAST-OAD-CS25 (thus contains only the mission model). (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/414)
    - IndepVarComp variables in FAST-OAD models are now correctly handled and included in input data file. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/408)
    - Changes in mission module. Most noticeable change is that the number of engines is no more an input of the mission module, but should be handled by the propulsion model. No impact when using the base CS-25 process, since the variable name has not changed.(https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/411)

        - Unification of performance module. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/251)
            - Breguet computations are now defined using the mission input file.
            - A computed mission can now be integrated or not to the sizing process.
        - Better management of speed parameters in Atmosphere class. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/281)
        - More robust airfoil profile processing. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/256)
        - Added tuner parameter in computation of compressibility. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/258)

Version 0.5.4-beta
==================

- Bug fix: An infinite loop could occur if custom modules were declaring the same variable
  several times with different units or default values.


Version 0.5.3-beta
==================

- Added compatibility with OpenMDAO 3.4, which is now the minimum required
  version of OpenMDAO. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/231)
- Simplified call to VariableViewer. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/221)
- Bug fix: model for compressibility drag now takes into account sweep angle
  and thickness ratio. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/237)
- Bug fix: at installation, minimum version of Scipy is forced to 1.2. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/219)
- Bug fix: SpeedChangeSegment class now accepts Mach number as possible target. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/234)
- Bug fix: variable "data:weight:aircraft_empty:mass has now "kg" as unit. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/236)


Version 0.5.2-beta
==================

- Added compatibility with OpenMDAO 3.3. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/210)
- Added computation time in log info. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/211)
- Fixed bug in XFOIL input file. (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/208)
- Fixed bug in copy_resource_folder(). (https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/pull/212)

Version 0.5.1-beta
==================

- Now avoids apparition of numerous deprecation warnings from OpenMDAO.

Version 0.5.0-beta
==================

- Added compatibility with OpenMDAO 3.2.
- Added the mission performance module (currently computes a fixed standard mission).
- Propulsion models are now declared in a specific way so that another
  module can do a direct call to the needed propulsion model.

Version 0.4.2-beta
==================

- Prevents installation of OpenMDAO 3.2 and above for incompatibility reasons.
- In Breguet module, output values for climb and descent distances were 1000 times
  too large (computation was correct, though).

Version 0.4.0-beta
==================

Some changes in mass and performances components:
    - The Breguet performance model can now be adjusted through input variables
      in the "settings" section.
    - The mass-performance loop is now done through the "fastoad.loop.mtow"
      component.

Version 0.3.1-beta
==================

- Adapted the FAST-OAD code to handle OpenMDAO version 3.1.1.

Version 0.3.0-beta
==================

- In Jupyter notebooks, VariableViewer now has a column for input/output type.
- Changed base OAD process so that propulsion model can now be directly called
  by the performance module instead of being a separate OpenMDAO component (which
  is still possible, though). It prepares the import of FAST legacy
  mission-based performance model.

Version 0.2.2-beta
==================

- Changed dependency requirement to have OpenMDAO version at most 3.1.0
  (FAST-OAD is not yet compatible with 3.1.1)

Version 0.2.1-beta
==================

- Fixed compatibility with wop 1.9 for XDSM generation


Version 0.2.0b
==============

- First beta release


Version 0.1.0a
==============

- First alpha release
